        <p class="p-moon">
            The Moon is the only natural satellite orbiting Earth. It orbits around Earth at an average distance of
            384,399 kilometres (238,854 mi),[f] a distance roughly 30 times the width of Earth, and completes an orbit
            (lunar month) in relation to Earth and the Sun (synodically) every 29.5 days. The Moon and Earth
            gravitationally pull on each other. The resulting tidal forces are the main drivers of Earth's tides, and
            have forced the Moon to face Earth with always the same near side, effectively synchronizing the Moon's
            rotation period (lunar day) to its orbital period (lunar month). This makes the Moon tidally locked to
            Earth.

        <p class="p-moon">
            In geophysical terms, the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of the
            Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as the
            contiguous United States). Within the Solar System, it is larger and more massive than any known dwarf
            planet, and the fifth-largest and fifth-most massive moon, as well as the largest and most massive in
            relation to its parent planet.[18] Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, about half that of
            Mars, and the second-highest among all moons in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the
            Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with only a minuscule hydrosphere, atmosphere, and magnetic field.
            The lunar surface is covered in regolith dust, which mainly consists of the fine material ejected from the
            lunar crust by impact events. The lunar crust is marked by impact craters, with some younger ones featuring
            bright ray-like streaks. The Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, surfacing lava mostly
            on the thinner near side of the Moon, filling ancient craters, which through cooling formed the today
            prominently visible dark plains of basalt called maria ('seas'). The Moon formed out of material from Earth,
            ejected by a giant impact into Earth of a hypothesized Mars-sized body named Theia 4.51 billion years ago,
            not long after Earth's formation.
